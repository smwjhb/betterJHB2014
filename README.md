Hacking for A Better Johannesburg

“The Future of Now: Always on, Always Connected” theme governs Social Media Week Johannesburg 2014. Committed to a collaborative effort towards developing the city’s infrastructure, Social Media Week Johannesburg partners with JoziHub and the City of Johannesburg on the “A Better Johannesburg, Developer Challenge 2014” - an exciting initiative designed to align creative talents in the fields of app development, design, engineering and more. 

We invite leading thinkers and doers who have a passion to see their city shine to come together and create web and mobile apps that will benefit the citizens of Johannesburg. 

This unique developer challenge will play out over a period of two days, in which the wide-ranging participating teams roll up their sleeves and get stuck in the business of creating solutions aimed at making Jozi a better place to live, work and socialize.

A Better Johannesburg, Developer Challenge aims to encourage the teams to build apps that encompass any of the following areas:
- Public transportation
- Service delivery and utilities
- Healthcare
- Community engagement
- Arts and Culture and more

Code created during the challenge will be contributed to this repository for use by the greater community.
